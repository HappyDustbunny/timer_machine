# Timer Machine
I have always disliked the way calendars are organised: Time is linear to me, 
not zig-zaggy like a normal month view. 

Timer Machine is an atttempt to make a 3D layout for calendars. 

Maybe I'll play more with the concept some day. I still like the look. 
Trouble is that the 3D package I used isn't too hot on big chunks of text. 
Maybe HTML5 can be bullied into doing something along these lines?
